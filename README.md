# COMP426 Final Project

# Backend
This project has a backend that stores usernames and passwords in a database. Usernames and passwords are added to the database and can also be deleted. Passwords can be updated via the "Forgot Password" hyperlink. To login, the password has to match for the given username. The implementation of the backend fulfills the CRUD requirement.
