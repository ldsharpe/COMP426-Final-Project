# COMP426 Final Project

# Overview
The project is a US Weather App that provides weather information for the targeted city/state. It uses two APIs (Geocoding API and Weather API) to handle the weather information.

# Backend
This project has a backend that stores usernames and passwords in a database. Usernames and passwords are added to the database and can also be deleted. Passwords can be updated via the "Forgot Password" hyperlink. To login, the password has to match for the given username. The implementation of the backend fulfills the CRUD requirement.

# Frontend
Makes use of event handling (JavaScript listens for the form submission and triggers the API request) and user interaction via input fields. The frontend design ensures that users can quickly access the weather information they need while enjoying a smooth and visually appealing experience.
